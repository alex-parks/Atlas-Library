# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Docker Environment Communication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish reliable communication between Houdini and Docker containers
# Details:
Implement robust Docker container communication for database operations:

- Configure connection to ArangoDB via internal Docker network (`arangodb:8529`)
- Handle host-to-container path mapping for asset files
- Implement environment variable loading from project root `.env`
- Support both direct Python imports and subprocess execution methods
- Add comprehensive error handling for Docker connectivity issues
- Implement connection pooling and timeout management
- Support development and production environment configurations

Docker integration specifics:
- Host path: `/net/library/atlaslib/...` â†’ Container path: `/app/assets/...`
- Use `blacksmith-atlas-backend` container for database access
- Leverage existing docker-compose.yml network configuration
- Environment variables: ARANGO_HOST=arangodb, ARANGO_PORT=8529

# Test Strategy:
Test Docker container communication, path mapping accuracy, and environment configuration loading. Verify connection reliability under various network conditions and container states.
