- Integration tests for end-to-end Houdini-to-database workflow
- Docker container communication validation
- Environment configuration testing
- Error scenario and recovery testing
- Performance benchmarking (<2 second addition to export time)
- Concurrent export operation testing

**Documentation:**
- Installation and configuration guide
- Troubleshooting documentation for common issues
- API reference for database integration functions
- Deployment checklist for production environments
- Rollback procedures for any issues

**Success Metrics:**
- >95% database connection success rate
- >99% document insertion success rate when database accessible
